# rl-envs-forge Documentation

Welcome to the `rl-envs-forge` project documentation. This README will guide you through the process of regenerating the documentation and how to use it.


## Regenerating the Documentation

1. **Navigate to the Docs Directory**:
   
```bash
cd docs
```


2. **Run Sphinx**:

```bash
make html
```

This command will regenerate the HTML documentation. The generated files are located in the `_build/html` directory.

## Accessing the Documentation

Once you've regenerated the documentation:

1. Navigate to the `_build/html` directory:

```bash
cd _build/html
```

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser. You can do this by dragging the file into your browser or right-clicking and choosing 'Open with' your preferred browser.
