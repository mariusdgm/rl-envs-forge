### Labyrinth 

Labyrinth is a classic maze-solving environment, where the goal is to navigate from a start point to a target. The maze layout is randomly generated based on a set of parametrizable arguments.

from time import sleep
from rl_envs_forge.envs.labyrinth.labyrinth import Labyrinth

env = Labyrinth(20, 20, seed=0)

done = False
quit_event = False
while not done and not quit_event:
    action = env.action_space.sample()  
    observation, reward, done, _, info = env.step(action)
    quit_event, _ = env.render()
    sleep(0.1)
```
